# What is `cc`? 
`cc` is an application for generalizing the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) (see also [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFpVDpKX70) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqKpkdRRLZw)) for polynomials of degree 1. Users will easily see that `cc` achieves this goal upon entering the functions $(3, 3^k, 2)$ for $k \in \mathbb{W}$, the iterations of which consistently arrive at loops containing $\lbrace 4 \cdot 3^k, 2 \cdot 3^k, 1 \cdot 3^k\rbrace$.
